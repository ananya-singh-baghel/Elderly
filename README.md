# ELDERLY

A Flutter project.

App helps caregivers manage stress, appointments, and health emergencies.
Provides information on elderly care options: long- term care, nursing, hospice, assisted living, etc and Focuses on 
social and personal requirements of seniors aging with dignity and assistance.

The elderly are an integral part of the population of any country who owe respect and attention equally to any other section.
However, due to changing family structure and modernization, the elderly population is facing inevitable challenges to live 
their life respectfully. Loneliness, negligence and less importance, illness due to aging and lack of treatment are the most
treacherous conditions that the elderly are facing.

Very old people, due to their reduced mobility and debilitating disabilities, need other people to do things for them.
With the increasing trend of nuclear families in society and with fewer children in the family, the care of older
persons in the families gets increasingly difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to safeguard elderly people who are absolutely
neglected, ill-treated, and vulnerable.

## 1 Product Perspective
### 1.1. Database
Elderly stores information regarding medicine intake, user data from the user and their point of contact in sql. This 
data can be secured further using encryption algorithms. The database’s role will be to host relevant documents and
relate elders’ and caregivers’ information in a meaningful way.

### 1.2. Application
A portal which is required for the user to interact and exploit the functionalities. This is the system's user-facing 
component, and usability will be given considerable emphasis during implementation. Most importantly, a successful 
deployment of this user interface will speed up access to and improve the presentation of the functionalities.

### 1.3. Caregiver’s component
Another viewpoint of application is necessary to allow the caregivers to keep tabs on their elder ones and into 
their specific activities. This will allow the elders and caregivers to be connected and verify the elder’s session
using the digital logs.
